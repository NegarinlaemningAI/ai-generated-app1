## What Worked Well
Using AI for code generation streamlined the development process. The clear prompts allowed for step-by-step feature implementation, ensuring the functional requirements were met effectively. Leveraging SQLite for persistent data storage and the Rich library for the user interface provided a robust and visually appealing solution.

## Challenges
Some challenges arose in fine-tuning prompts to produce optimal code. The iterative process of testing and refining the generated code required additional manual intervention, particularly in error handling and UI enhancements. Additionally, the AI occasionally generated redundant or suboptimal code snippets.

## Lessons Learned
This experiment highlighted the importance of precise prompts when using AI tools. While AI can accelerate development, human oversight is essential for achieving a polished, user-friendly application. The integration of AI with manual coding can yield efficient and high-quality results when combined effectively.
